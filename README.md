# Orrery
Orrery, displaying the major planets and moons

This Orrery allow to display the angle of the major planets and their moons.
Attention ! It doesn't respect size or distance, it only take into account angles from the Sun, and from the parent planet for the moons.

### Usage
First, you have to run the script in the data folder. It will download and format data from the NASA to our use. It will take a loooonnng time, and around 190MB of disk space. Or use the data already there.
Then, you can open the index.html, or if you have a PHP enabled web server, index.php.
That's all !
Note, it's not that visible, but there is a little 3D effect, particularly on the moons of Uranus, to display more accurately the positions of the moons (before or behind the planet from the POV of the observer.

### Legals
The licence is WTFTHYW. I would love you to keep my pseudo around somewhere, if you fork/use the code, but whatever.
This project uses D3.js https://d3js.org and astronomy.js from Don Cross http://cosinekitty.com/solar_system.html. I did a bit of modifications/cleaning in this last one, but nothing drastic.
